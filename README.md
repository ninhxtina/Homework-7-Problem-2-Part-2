### 2. Write a performance comparison test for MaxHeapN and  MaxHeapLogN (20pt)

Write a performance test code that compare the performance in time of 

```java
    public void MaxHeapLogN(Integer[] data) {
        // homework
    }

    public void MaxHeapN(Integer[] data) {
        // homework
    }
```

Produce a graph that's similar to what we have seen in class for other performance tests. The x-axis is the size of the input data and the y-axis is the time it takes to run the function. Your graph should demonstrate a performance relationsip similarly to the theoratical complexity of one being O(n) and the other being O(nlogn).

 Add your performance test code, data file and graph image to a separate repo. Acceptable format for graph image includes jpeg, png, pdf, etc. Note that ***Microsoft Excel workbook file .xlsx is NOT acceptable as the graph image format***.
